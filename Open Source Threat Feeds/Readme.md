These are open source threat feeds that have been currated to supporrt the STIX 1.x format for use with the ExtraHop Reveal(x) Discover appliance.  These ARE NOT SUPPORTED and please do not call tech support for assistance with them.  If you have an issue feel free to email me at john@wiredata.net and I will attempt to get back to you on them but do keep in mind, if I am currently on an engagement it may be awhile. 

If you are NOT using these feeds with an existing ExtraHop appliance you are obviously still free to use them and I am happy to help you to the extent possible but please do consider putting Reveal(x) on your radar in the future.

Thanks 

John Smith
